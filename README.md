# Phenology collections project


This project is for Erin Berkowitz's masters thesis in museum studies at the University of New Mexico. Analyses are not yet published, but I'm using this as a chance to learn how to sync my code and make things reproducible, etc.

This project considers flowering phenology at two mountain sites in Colorado. Erin Berkowitz leads the project as a museum's and herbarium master's student with Dr. Hannah Marx at UNM. I, Lizzie, am helping with data analysis.
